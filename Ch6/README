I left as a set of scripts. Hopefully that isn't an issue. The order would be


probability-bounds.jl    # Ch 6.2
weak-law.jl              # Ch 6.3
pdf-sum-gaussian.jl      # Ch 6.4
convergence-distribution.jl
poisson-gaussian.jl
clt-visualize.jl
clt-moment.jl
clt-failure.jl

I took some liberties rewriting the code in a more Julian style.
