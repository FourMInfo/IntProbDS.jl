Julia code to accompany _Introduction to Probability for Data Science_ by Stanley H. Chan (https://probability4datascience.com/index.html)

This archive is to hold Julia translations of the Matlab and Python code that accompanies the book. The goal is to make straightforward translations of the code, with the emphasis on clarity and understandability for undergraduate students. This effort has been authorized by Stanley H. Chan.

Please prepare translations so that code blocks can be pasted into a fresh REPL that has the project activated, or run as blocks from VS Code using CTRL-enter. Code blocks should run at global scope, though they may contain functions, if needed.

Contributions are welcome, please make pull requests!
