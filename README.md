This holds Julia translations of the Matlab and Python code that accompanies the book. This effort has been authorized by Stanley H. Chan.

To use this code:
* download or clone the archive to some directory.
* Go to that directory, and start Julia with ```julia --proj```. 
* The first time you do this, enter ```] instantiate``` to install all of the needed packages, followed by CTRL-C to go back to the Julia prompt.
* then, copy the code block you desire to run, and paste it into the Julia REPL.
